Usage
================================================================================
You can get help on usage by invoking the program with the help option like that

    ./schedule.py --help

Normally, assuming you have a file named ./problem.txt that contains the 
problem to solve, you will use the program like this

    ./schedule.py problem.txt 300

where problem.txt is the problem file and 300 means the computation budget is
300 seconds.

Problem details are given in tp3-A11.pdf and you should read this file first
before using the script.
